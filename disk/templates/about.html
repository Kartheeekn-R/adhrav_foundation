					<p>The dogs in the street often are left unnoticed and unattended too. Through our man’s best friend drive, we feed street dogs on regular basis with a good meal filled with all their favourites. The amount of excitement and love that these voiceless animals show is what pushes this drive for Adhrav foundation. We have impacted around 1,23,000 street dogs in total in and around chennai.</p>

					<p>Our first initiative from Adhrav foundation was the food distribution drive. It was the need of the hour during the lockdown period as the whole world was affected with Covid- 19. We were distributing food packets on daily basis to the people who had lost their homes due the virus, homeless people in the streets, street vendors, corporation workers and also Covid positive patients. Our food distribution drive has been successfully going on for a year now. We have covered almost almost all the places in chennai. We have provided around 8,82,000 food packets to the needy people. And we are going to achieve more through this drive in the future. Reactivating hunger for the needy people is one of the crucial aims of adhrav foundation.</p>

                                        Our Reach On The Bridge Project
After our first step in the Pallavaram and Pammal area, we have expanded our project to other parts of chennai. From January 2022, we are working on locations such as Perambur, Maduravoyal, Ambattur, Ashok Nagar, Korattur, Mogappair, Periyar Nagar, Villivakkam, etc. This is a huge step towards this project and we hope to cover all this area under “The Bridge” Project and provide help and support for the children located here. With this collaboration and volunteer participation, this project is all set to go. Various college clubs have come forward to collaborate with for volunteering and interacting with the children in these areas.
